# Gap Analysis Template — Research Pipeline

> Use at any stage when you suspect the research has gaps. Run this checklist, identify what's missing, and loop back to fill it.

## When to Use

- After Source Discovery (Stage 2) — are there enough sources?
- During Deep Research (Stage 3) — are themes fully covered?
- During Verification (Stage 4) — are claims adequately supported?
- During Review (Stage 6) — are all questions answered?

## Gap Analysis Checklist

### Coverage Gaps

```markdown
| Research Question | Sources Found | Min Required | Gap? | Action |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|------|--------|
| Q1 | [X] Tier A/B | 3 | [Yes/No] | [Loop to Stage 2 / Accept gap] |
| Q2 | [X] Tier A/B | 3 | [Yes/No] | [...] |
```

### Source Diversity Gaps

For each research question, check source diversity:
- [ ] Multiple source TYPES (not just web articles)
- [ ] Multiple PERSPECTIVES (not just one viewpoint)
- [ ] Multiple GEOGRAPHIES (if topic is international)
- [ ] Multiple TIME PERIODS (if historical context matters)
- [ ] BOTH supporting AND opposing evidence

### Evidence Quality Gaps

- [ ] Any key claim resting on a single source?
- [ ] Any claim with only Tier C sources?
- [ ] Any statistics without methodology context?
- [ ] Any quotes without attribution?
- [ ] Any "common knowledge" claims without verification?

### Temporal Gaps

- [ ] Are findings current enough for the topic's pace of change?
- [ ] Is there historical context where needed?
- [ ] Are future projections based on current data?

### Perspective Gaps

- [ ] Are minority/contrarian views represented?
- [ ] Are different stakeholder perspectives covered?
- [ ] Is there geographic diversity in sources?
- [ ] Are potential biases in the source set acknowledged?

## Gap Response Actions

| Gap Type | Severity | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Zero sources for a question | Critical | Loop to Stage 2 with new search strategies |
| Single source for key claim | High | Targeted search for corroboration |
| No opposing evidence sought | High | Counter-evidence search (Stage 4 protocol) |
| Outdated sources only | Medium | Search for recent updates |
| Single perspective | Medium | Search alternative viewpoints |
| Missing source category | Low-Medium | Check if that category would add value |
| Minor attribution gap | Low | Quick verification search |

## Template Output

```markdown
# Gap Analysis: [Research Title]
**Run at:** Stage [X] | **Date:** [Date]

## Gaps Identified
1. **[Gap description]** — Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
   - Affected questions: [Q numbers]
   - Action: [What to do]
   
2. **[Gap description]** — Severity: [X]
   - Affected questions: [Q numbers]
   - Action: [What to do]

## Resolution Plan
- [ ] [Action 1] — ETA: [time]
- [ ] [Action 2] — ETA: [time]

## Accepted Gaps (with justification)
- [Gap]: Accepted because [reason — e.g., topic too niche, data doesn't exist, out of scope]
