# Research Pipeline — Ultra-Comprehensive Research Framework

> From vague question to verified, cited, decision-ready report.

## Overview

A 7-stage pipeline for conducting thorough, multi-source research with full verification and Notion-integrated deliverables. Designed for AI agents with web search, web fetch, and Notion API access.

Every key claim is triangulated (3+ independent sources). Every finding is confidence-rated. Every step is documented in Notion for human review.

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | File | Input → Output |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **0** | `00-clarification-scoping.md` | Vague request → **RESEARCH_BRIEF.md** |
| **1** | `01-research-planning.md` | Brief → **RESEARCH_PLAN.md** (source matrix, search strategies) |
| **2** | `02-source-discovery.md` | Plan → **SOURCE_REGISTRY.md** (catalogued, scored sources) |
| **3** | `03-deep-research.md` | Sources → **RESEARCH_NOTES.md** (extracted findings by theme) |
| **4** | `04-verification.md` | Notes → **VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** (confidence-rated claims) |
| **5** | `05-synthesis.md` | Verified findings → **RESEARCH_REPORT.md** (final report) |
| **6** | `06-review-handoff.md` | Report → **Quality check + Notion delivery** |

## Notion Integration

Each stage creates or updates a Notion sub-page under the research project page. The final structure:

```
📋 [Research Project Title]
├── 📄 Research Brief
├── 📄 Research Plan
├── 📄 Source Registry
├── 📄 Research Notes
├── 📄 Verification Matrix
├── 📄 Final Report
└── 📄 Review & Follow-ups
```

## How to Use

1. Receive a research request
2. Walk stages 0→6 sequentially
3. Each stage's output feeds the next
4. Post deliverables to Notion at each stage
5. At stage 6, notify the requester for review

## Quality Standards

- **Triangulation:** Every key claim needs 3+ independent sources
- **Confidence rating:** High / Medium / Low / Unverified on all findings
- **Source scoring:** Authority, recency, relevance, bias assessment
- **Iteration:** If gaps found at any stage, loop back to fill them
- **Attribution:** Every fact, statistic, and quote has a cited source
